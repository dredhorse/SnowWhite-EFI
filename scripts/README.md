# Scripts

These are just scripts I use to maintain this repo. They have nothing to do with my Hackintosh install.

You can just ignore everything in here.

## Repo-Scripts

Those files have been taken from https://github.com/cmer/gigabyte-z390-aorus-master-hackintosh

Modified to support:

- different location in folder structure
- creating of private information file
- adding private information back into config.plist
- saving config.plist with private information back into /Volumes/EFI/OC
